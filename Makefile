# This is a prototype Makefile. Modify it according to your needs.
# You should at least check the settings for
# DEVICE ....... The AVR device you compile for
# CLOCK ........ Target AVR clock rate in Hertz
# OBJECTS ...... The object files created from your source files. This list is
#                usually the same as the list of source files with suffix ".o".
# PROGRAMMER ... Options to avrdude which define the hardware you use for
#                uploading to the AVR and the interface where this hardware
#                is connected. We recommend that you leave it undefined and
#                add settings like this to your ~/.avrduderc file:
#                   default_programmer = "stk500v2"
#                   default_serial = "avrdoper"
# FUSES ........ Parameters for avrdude to flash the fuses appropriately.

DEVICE     = atmega2560

# ATMega8 fuse bits used above (fuse bits for other devices are different!):
# Example for 8 MHz internal oscillator
# Fuse high byte:

#        ^ ^ ^ ^   ^ ^ ^------ BOOTSZ0
#        | | | |   | +-------- BOOTSZ1
#        | | | |   +---------- EESAVE (set to 0 to preserve EEPROM over chip erase)
#        | | | +-------------- CKOPT (clock option, depends on oscillator type)
#        | | +---------------- SPIEN (if set to 1, serial programming is disabled)
#        | +------------------ WDTON (if set to 0, watchdog is always on)
#        +-------------------- RSTDISBL (if set to 0, RESET pin is disabled)
